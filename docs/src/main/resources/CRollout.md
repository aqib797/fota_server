hawkBit supports an easy and flexible rollout management which allows you to update a large amount of devices in separated groups.

- Cascading start of the deployment groups based on installation status of the previous group.
- Emergency shutdown of the rollout in case a group exceeds the defined error threshold.
- Rollout progress monitoring for the entire rollout and the individual groups.
